#Goal: 

New roommates want to fully stock their new apartment with dishes, appliances, and furniture, but it's tough to know who has the best couch, who has a full set of nice dishes, and who just has a nice smile. 

Enter MiMo, a service that allows new roommates to quickly and easily list what they already have. 

1.) Using this information, MiMo compiles a shopping cart of necessary items. In one easy step, the group can buy all the necessities for a new apartment based on their stated budget. MiMo will be delay sending the order if necessary so that the items can be delivered to the new apartment on a specified day. 

2.) Upon moving out, roommates can use MiMo to bid on household items that they want to take with them. MiMo will use each roommate's preferences to draw up a sheet of who pays what to whom, and who gets the nice couch.
