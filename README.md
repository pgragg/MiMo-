#Goal: 

New roommates want to fully stock their new apartment with dishes, appliances, and furniture, but it's tough to know who has the best couch, who has a full set of nice dishes, and who just has a nice smile. 

Enter MiMo, a service that allows new roommates to quickly and easily list what they already have. 

1.) Using this information, MiMo will, in the future, compile a shopping cart of necessary items. In one easy step, the group should be able to buy all the necessities for a new apartment based on their stated budget. MiMo will delay sending the order if necessary so that the items can be delivered to the new apartment on a specified day. 

2.) Upon moving out, roommates should be able to use MiMo to bid on household items that they want to take with them. MiMo should use each roommate's preferences to draw up a sheet of who pays what to whom, and who gets the nice couch. 

#What's the story here?  

This app was created at AngelHack 2015 in 24 hours by an 
-API guy (Python and server setup), 
-a design gal (Everything Adobe, and then some), and 
-myself (the Rails, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS guy). 

3 of those hours were used for the best nap of our lives. 

#So what do I do with it? 

Run it on Heroku, if you like. Extend it, if you're adventurous. 

Everything is vanilla Rails. 

#Pull requests, anyone? 

The next step for this app is to incorporate the Amazon shopping cart API. :D
